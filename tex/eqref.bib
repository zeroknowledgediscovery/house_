abstract = {Romanowicz [1993] suggested that great earthquakes alternate in a predictable fashion between strike-slip and dip-slip mechanisms on a 20–30 year cycle. We investigate whether or not the observed pattern of shifting predominance between strike slip and dip slip is capable of frequent reproduction by random simulation. To accomplish this, we randomly drew strike-slip and dip-slip events in the same proportion as in the historic record and determined how frequently a pattern of predominance similar to the historic record is generated. Out of 1000 simulations a pattern similar to the historic record was observed 183 times. This throws considerable doubt on Romanowicz's [1993] conslusion that a mechanism is at work producing the distribution she observed of great earthquakes. The difficulty in coming to conclusions from data of the type used by Romanowicz [1993] is explored, along with the psychological literature on the difficulty of detecting random and nonrandom patterns from relatively small amounts of information.},

This pattern suggests that a global transfer mechanism from poloidal to toroidal components of tectonic plate motions is operating on time scales of several decades. The increase in seismic activity in California in recent years may be related to an acceleration of global strike-slip moment release, as regions of shear deformation mature after being reached by stresses that have propagated away from regions of great subduction decoupling earthquakes in the 1960s.},

Many of the triggered areas also are sites of geothermal and recent volcanic activity.

The most promising explanations involve nonlinear interactions between large dynamic strains accompanying seismic waves from the mainshock and crustal fluids (perhaps including crustal magma).},

By calculating the change in Coulomb failure stress on the Nojima fault due to 1944/46 to 1995 postseismic relaxation of a thin low-viscosity channel beneath southwest Japan, we show that stress diffusion from the 1940s interplate earthquakes increased the likelihood of future failure on the Nojima fault by slowly but progressively unloading the normal stress on the fault over a 50-yr period.},

abstract ={Many observations suggest that relatively small changes in stress may trigger or inhibit earthquakes. This result is surprising because the perturbing stress is only a small fraction of the stress drop from the affected earthquake. We investigate this phenomenon by simulating the earthquake fault with a numerical model that is physically realistic. A fault is not homogeneous, and therefore, the failure criteria will vary over the surface of the fault. We model fault heterogeneity as simple Coulomb failure on smaller but mostly uniform areas that comprise the fault. As a result of multiple (and repeated) failures over these small areas, the fault can have a very uneven stored stress. We show that it is possible for small changes in confining stress of a few tenths of a bar to advance or retard the occurrence of large earthquakes by decades. Because such stress changes can be generated by nearby earthquakes, and over much longer time scales by postseismic strain diffusion from large distant earthquakes, estimates of the probabilities of earthquake occurrence must take into account these stress perturbations in order to be reliable.},

abstract ={Postseismic displacements and strains observed at the earth's surface can be explained through the relaxation of a viscoelastic asthenosphere underlying a purely elastic crust. A theory is presented for modeling the effects of postseismic relaxation on a spherically symmetric earth. For an earthquake point source located in the upper elastic layer, the displacement field is decomposed into its toroidal and spheroidal components. A linear (Maxwell) rheology in the viscoelastic layers is assumed, enabling the use of the correspondence principle for the solutions of the equations of static equilibrium. Displacement and strain fields are then calculated using normal mode summation. Computational results are presented for two simple earthquake sources: a strike slip fault and a uniaxial thrust fault. The patterns of postseismic displacements and strains are found to depend strongly on both the earth model and earthquake source geometry. In particular, the elastic plate thickness, asthenosphere thickness, fault type, and fault length each play a major role in determining the spatial pattern of postseismic relaxation effects. Asthenospheric viscosity controls the temporal pattern of relaxation.},

Complete catalogues exhibit both short- and long-term clustering for earthquakes of all depth ranges. After accounting for the effect of short-term clustering, we find that in residual (declustered) catalogues, long-term clustering, not periodicity, characterizes the occurrence of all earthquakes—shallow, intermediate, and deep. The degree of clustering in residual catalogues is the same for earthquakes in different depth ranges. Circumstantial evidence indicates that the long-term variation of seismicity is governed by a power-law temporal distribution; as in short-term clustering, it is scale invariant. The fractal dimension of an earthquake set on the time axis is of the order of 0.8–0.9. Therefore, mainshock occurrence is closer to a stationary Poisson process than standard aftershock sequences of shallow earthquakes.},

We analyse the space–time correlations of a worldwide seismicity data set (CNSS catalogue, 1963–1998, M≥ 5, depth ≤70 km), and show that seismic activity diffuses away from an earthquake as the time delay increases following its occurrence. Two regimes are observed: a slow diffusion at short timescales (up to 10 days) during which the mean distance R(Δt) between the initial earthquake and the subsequent earthquakes grows as R(Δt) ∼ΔtH, with H= 0.19, and a second regime at longer timescales with H= 0.4. The growth exponent H in the first regime increases systematically with the size of the initial earthquake, but no such dependence is observed for the second regime. Associating the latter with the viscous diffusion of stress in the upper mantle, we obtain an estimate of about 1017 Pa s for the asthenospheric lateral viscosity. This diffusion indicates that the relaxation response of the crust to a stress step depends non-linearly, in respect of both its intensity and general form, on the perturbation. A positive correlation between the regional heat flow and diffusion exponent is found, suggesting a strong thermal control on the diffusion. The overall auto-decorrelation and this diffusion process are the two major mechanisms by which seismicity systems relax stress concentrations, by redistributing them in space and in time. Both processes exhibit typical power-law behaviours, supporting the notion of space–time scale invariance of stress exchanges between seismically active faults.},

abstract ={Temporal clustering of the larger earthquakes (foreshock-mainshock-aftershock) followed by relative quiescence (stress shadow) are characteristic of seismic cycles along plate boundaries. A global seismic-moment release history, based on a little more than 100 years of instrumental earthquake data in an extended version of the catalog of Pacheco and Sykes (1992), illustrates similar behavior for Earth as a whole. Although the largest earthquakes have occurred in the circum-Pacific region, an analysis of moment release in the hemisphere antipodal to the Pacific plate shows a very similar pattern. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the global temporal clustering of great shallow earthquakes during 1952–1964 at M ≥ 9.0 is highly significant (4\% random probability) as is the clustering of the events of M ≥ 8.6 (0.2\% random probability) during 1950–1965. We have extended the Pacheco and Sykes (1992) catalog from 1989 through 2001 using Harvard moment centroid data. Immediately after the 1950–1965 cluster, significant quiescence at and above M 8.4 begins and continues until 2001 (0.5\% random probability). In alternative catalogs derived by correcting for possible random errors in magnitude estimates in the extended Pacheco–Sykes catalog, the clustering of M ≥ 9 persists at a significant level. These observations indicate that, for great earthquakes, Earth behaves as a coherent seismotectonic system. A very-large-scale mechanism for global earthquake triggering and/or stress transfer is implied. There are several candidates, but so far only viscoelastic relaxation has been modeled on a global scale.},

abstract ={Stress changes in the crust due to an earthquake can hasten the failure of neighbouring faults and induce earthquake sequences in some cases. The 1999 Hector Mine earthquake in southern California (magnitude 7.1) occurred only 20 km from, and 7 years after, the 1992 Landers earthquake (magnitude 7.3). This suggests that the Hector Mine earthquake was triggered in some fashion by the earlier event. But uncertainties in the slip distribution and rock friction properties associated with the Landers earthquake have led to widely varying estimates of both the magnitude and sign of the resulting stress change that would be induced at the location of the Hector Mine hypocentre—with estimates varying from -1.4 bar (ref. 6) to +0.5 bar (ref. 7). More importantly, coseismic stress changes alone cannot satisfactorily explain the delay of 7 years between the two events. Here we present the results of a three-dimensional viscoelastic model that simulates stress transfer from the ductile lower crust and upper mantle to the brittle upper crust in the 7 years following the Landers earthquake. Using viscoelastic parameters that can reproduce the observed horizontal surface deformation following the Landers earthquake, our calculations suggest that lower-crustal or upper-mantle flow can lead to postseismic stress increases of up to 1–2 bar at the location of the Hector Mine hypocentre during this time period, contributing to the eventual occurrence of the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake. These results attest to the importance of considering viscoelastic processes in the assessment of seismic hazard},

Also, paleoseismic observations documenting much longer time periods display a time clustering of major events. We demonstrate with simple mechanical concepts that postseismic stress relaxation magnifies the coseismic stress change and has a major effect on fault interaction during the seismic cycle.

This situation is similar to the previous case of the 1997   normal-faulting event (Mw = 7.1) that occurred beneath the rupture area of the 1985 Michoacan,   Mexico, earthquake (Mw = 8.1). We investigate the possibility of any stress interactions between   the preceding 1978 thrust and the following 1999 normal-faulting earthquakes. For   this purpose, we estimate the temporal change of the stress state in the subducting   Cocos plate by calculating the slip distribution during the 1978 earthquake through   teleseismic waveform inversion, the dynamic rupture process, and the resultant   coseismic stress change, together with the postseismic stress variations due to   plate convergence and the viscoelastic relaxation process. To do this, we calculate   the coseismic and postseismic changes of all stress components in a   three-dimensional space, incorporating the subducting slab, the overlying crust and   uppermost mantle, and the asthenosphere. For the coseismic stress change we solve   elastodynamic equations, incorporating the kinematic fault slip as an observational   constraint under appropriate boundary conditions. To estimate postseismic stress   accumulations due to plate convergence, a virtual backward slip is imposed to lock   the main thrust zone. The effects of viscoelastic stress relaxations of the   coseismic change and the back slip are also included. The maximum coseismic increase   in the shear stress and the Coulomb failure stress below the downdip edge of the   1978 thrust fault is estimated to be in the range between 0.5 and 1.5 MPa, and the   1999 normal-faulting earthquake was found to take place in this zone of stress   increase. The postseismic variations during the 21 years after the 1978 event modify   the magnitude and patterns of the coseismic stress change to some extent but are not   large enough to overcome the coseismic change. These results suggest that the   coseismic stress increase due to the 1978 thrust earthquake may have enhanced the   chance of occurrence of the 1999 normal-faulting event in the subducting plate. If   this is the case, one of the possible mechanisms could be static fatigue of rock   materials around preexisting weak planes involved in the subducting plate, and it is   speculated that that one of these planes might have been reactivated and fractured   because of stress corrosion cracking under the applied stress there for 21  years.},

Each of the larger (M ≥ 8) earthquakes involved strike-slip faulting averaging more than 5 m and rupture lengths of several hundred kilometers. Available geologic data indicate that recurrence intervals on the major source faults are several thousands of years and distances of about 400 km separate the respective rupture areas. We propose that the occurrences of these and many smaller earthquakes are related and controlled to a large extent by stress changes generated by the compounded static deformation of the preceding earthquakes and subsequent viscoelastic relaxation of the lower crust and upper mantle beneath Mongolia. We employ a spherically layered viscoelastic model constrained by the 1994–2002 GPS velocity field in western Mongolia [Vergnolle et al., 2003]. Using the succession of twentieth century earthquakes as sources of deformation, we then analyze the time-dependent change in Coulomb failure stress. At remote interaction distances, static stress values are small. However, modeled postseismic stress changes typically accumulate to several tenths of a bar over time intervals of decades. Almost all significant twentieth century regional earthquakes (M > 6) with well-constrained fault geometry lie in positive stress lobes of magnitude about +0.5 bar. Our results suggest that significant stress transfer is possible among continental faults separated by hundreds of kilometers and on timescales of decades.},

There are two unusual features of the most recent great earthquakes off southwest Honshu. The Tonankai and Nankaido earthquakes were relatively early compared to the historical record of past occurrence, and the Tokai section of the Tonankai fault did not fail in 1944 whereas it probably had for the previous ∼1000 years. We show that both phenomena can be explained by postseismic strain diffusion from the great Nobi, Japan, earthquake (M 8.0) in 1891. It is believed to have produced stress changes that influenced the time of occurrence of the great Tonankai (M 7.9) and Nankaido (M 8.0) earthquakes in the mid-1940’s. The pattern of long-term viscoelastic deformation following the Nobi earthquake suggests that the failure threshold was reduced in the southwest section of the Nankai Trough, which may have acted to trigger the Tonankai and Nankaido events. In contrast, the threshold was increased in the eastern Tokai section of the thrust zone and therefore failure of this section may have been inhibited. We model fault failure and show that the stress levels from Nobi are adequate to account for the advance of Tonankai and the inhibition of Tokai.

abstract ={The spatiotemporal plot of epicenters of large (Ms>6.9) subduction earthquakes in Mexico (1900 to present day) suggests that these earthquakes cluster in space and time. In this work we test the hypothesis that the coseismic stress transfer may lead to this clustering. For the analysis we estimate the spatial extent of the coseismic Coulomb stress change for these large events and then perform a statistical analysis using the chi-square goodness-of-fit test for the interevent time intervals. We find that there are, at least, two groups of time intervals where the observed frequencies are much higher than that expected from a Poisson model, indicating a bimodal pattern. For the first mode, the observed frequencies for the 0- to 5-year interval becomes about 2.1 times the expectation, with a probability of occurrence of about 30\%. These results show that large thrust Mexican earthquakes between 1900 and 2003 are clustered in space and time probably due to stress interactions among them. The second mode includes the time interval of 30–50 years. In the interval of 30–40 years, the observed frequencies become about 1.7 times the expectation and about 1.2 times the expectation for the 40- to 50-year interval. This second mode could be associated with a reloading interval of tectonic stress due to the plate convergence and appears consistent with the long-term recurrence periods of large thrust earthquakes in the Mexican subduction zone.},

Our aim is to examine the effects of the spherical geometry, the vertical layering, and the self-gravitation on surface displacement field. For a 100 km long fault, spherical and flat models produce comparable coseismic deformations up to a distance of ∼300 km from the epicenter. This distance is sensibly reduced in the postseismic regime and when infinitely long strike-slip faults are considered. The differences between predictions based on flat and spherical models are due both to their global geometry and the effect of the gravity forces. Self-gravitation has a minor role with respect to that of sphericity for surface coseismic deformations, while in the postseismic regime its effects increase considerably. As a case study, we consider the coseismic and postseismic deformations due to the great 1960 Chilean earthquake. The results of the spherical stratified model differ sensibly from those of a flat uniform model. Moreover, within the framework of spherical Earth models, the rheological stratification plays a major role in determining the pattern of the displacement field. We show that the present-day rates of vertical and horizontal deformations are considerably large (∼10−2 m yr−1) for an asthenospheric viscosity ranging from 1019 to 1020 Pa s. These rates, which could possibly be detected by geodetic investigations, are found to be also sensitive to the rheological properties of the mantle beneath the asthenosphere.},

abstract = {The main objective of this study is to see if a lower threshold for earthquake triggering exists. Resolving this issue is important for the understanding of earthquake mechanics and for the purpose of hazard analysis. We compute the cumulative static stress changes imposed on 63 M ≥ 4.5 earthquakes in central California between 1969 and 1998, by adding the stress changes imposed by all previous M ≥ 4.5 earthquakes as a function of time prior to the events. We find that 85\% of the cumulative stress changes at the time of rupture are positive for stress change magnitudes of >10 kPa (>0.1 bar), and 70\% are positive for stress changes of <10 kPa (< 0.1 bar) as well as <1 kPa (<0.01 bar). A comparison between these results and those obtained for synthetic catalogs, in which the timing or focal mechanisms of the earthquakes were randomized, shows that this degree of triggering is very unlikely to be found in a random catalog. Thus we conclude that no lower threshold for earthquake triggering in central California has been found. We show that the temporal distribution of stress changes that discourage failure is consistent with the theoretical prediction that the time delay increases with the magnitude of the stress change.},

abstract ={We investigate the capability of the strongest earthquakes to modify significantly the seismicity in a wide spatiotemporal window. In particular, we show that the strongest earthquakes of last century were probably able to influence the seismicity at large spatiotemporal distances, extending their reach over thousands of kilometers and decades later. We report statistically significant differences in worldwide seismicity before and after the occurrence of the strongest earthquakes of the last century, whose perturbation is modeled by means of coseismic and postseismic stress variations. This long-term coupling has produced time variations in worldwide seismic activity that appear related to the physical coupling between the focal mechanism of source earthquakes and the tectonic setting of each zone. These results could provide new important insights on seismic hazard assessment because they raise doubts on the validity of two paradigms; that is, the steadiness of the mainshock rate and the isolation of a seismic region from the surrounding areas. Finally, in addition to this backward analysis, we also provide a formal forward test by forecasting the effects on global seismicity of the recent Sumatra–Andaman earthquakes; this is maybe a unique chance to test the long-term hypothesis with an independent dataset that avoids, by definition, any kind of (often unconscious) optimization of the results that is an unavoidable possibility in backward analyses.},

abstract = {A currently debated issue in seismology concerns the possible existence of coupling among earthquakes distant in space and time. Here, we provide the results of a simulation that mimics the coseismic and postseismic interactions in a spherical and viscoelastic Earth. In particular, the model estimates the stress induced by remote earthquakes at selected points on the Earth's surface, and the effects on a simple fault model. The obtained results indicate that a seismic zone can interact significantly with other remote seismic regions. Clusters in seismicity, gaps, and nonstationary behavior in general might be induced by the occurrence of large earthquakes at distances up to about 1000 km. These findings suggest that an implied paradigm of seismic hazard studies, i.e., seismic zones are isolated and stationary systems, should be regarded with extreme caution. Finally, we show some empirical evidence of possible long-term interaction in the seismicity of southern California.},

@article{poll95,
    abstract = {The 1995 Kobe earthquake produced predominantly right-lateral slip along the northeast-southwest-trending Nojima fault approximately 200 km landward of the Nankai trough, southwest Japan. The last major earthquakes along the Nankai trough, the M8.0 1944 Tonankai and M8.2 1946 Nankaido earthquakes, involved about 4 m of interplate slip, each releasing about 100 years of accumulated stress from the northwest-southeast convergence of the Philippine Sea ({PHS}) plate. By calculating the change in Coulomb failure stress on the Nojima fault due to 1944/46 to 1995 postseismic relaxation of a thin low-viscosity channel beneath southwest Japan, we show that stress diffusion from the 1940s interplate earthquakes increased the likelihood of future failure on the Nojima fault by slowly but progressively unloading the normal stress on the fault over a 50-yr period.},
