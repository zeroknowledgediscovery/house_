abstract={Learning a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from a training set of labeled strings is a hard task that has been much studied within the machine learning community. It is equivalent to learning a regular language by example and has applications in language modeling. In this paper, we describe a novel evolutionary method for learning DFA that evolves only the transition matrix and uses a simple deterministic procedure to optimally assign state labels. We compare its performance with the evidence driven state merging (EDSM) algorithm, one of the most powerful known DFA learning algorithms. We present results on random DFA induction problems of varying target size and training set density. We also study the effects of noisy training data on the evolutionary approach and on EDSM. On noise-free data, we find that our evolutionary method outperforms EDSM on small sparse data sets. In the case of noisy training data, we find that our evolutionary method consistently outperforms EDSM, as well as other significant methods submitted to two recent competitions.},

abstract={Computers and brains are modeled by finite and probabilistic automata, respectively. Probabilistic automata are known to be strictly more powerful than finite automata. The observation that the environment affects behavior of both computer and brain is made. Automata are then modeled in an environment. Theorem 1 shows that useful environmental models are those which are infinite sets. A probabilistic structure is placed on the environment set. Theorem 2 compares the behavior of finite (deterministic) and probabilistic automata in random environments. Several interpretations of Theorem 2 are discussed which offer some insight into some mathematical limits of machine intelligence.},

abstract={Relaxation labeling processes are a class of mechanisms that solve the problem of assigning labels to objects in a manner that is consistent with respect to some domain-specific constraints. We reformulate this using the model of a team of learning automata interacting with an environment or a high-level critic that gives noisy responses as to the consistency of a tentative labeling selected by the automata. This results in an iterative linear algorithm that is itself probabilistic. Using an explicit definition of consistency we give a complete analysis of this probabilistic relaxation process using weak convergence results for stochastic algorithms. Our model can accommodate a range of uncertainties in the compatibility functions. We prove a local convergence result and show that the point of convergence depends both on the initial labeling and the constraints. The algorithm is implementable in a highly parallel fashion.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider probabilistic context-free grammars, a class of generative devices that has been successfully exploited in several applications of syntactic pattern matching, especially in statistical natural language parsing. We investigate the problem of training probabilistic context-free grammars on the basis of distributions defined over an infinite set of trees or an infinite set of sentences by minimizing the cross-entropy. This problem has applications in cases of context-free approximation of distributions generated by more expressive statistical models. We show several interesting theoretical properties of probabilistic context-free grammars that are estimated in this way, including the previously unknown equivalence between the grammar cross-entropy with the input distribution and the so-called derivational entropy of the grammar itself. We discuss important consequences of these results involving the standard application of the maximum-likelihood estimator on finite tree and sentence samples, as well as other finite-state models such as hidden Markov models and probabilistic finite automata.},

    abstract = {{For centuries, scientists have attempted to identify and document analytical laws that underlie physical phenomena in nature. Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the  ” alphabet” used to describe those systems.}},

    abstract = {{The reverse engineering of metabolic networks from experimental data is traditionally a labor-intensive task requiring a priori systems knowledge. Using a proven model as a test system, we demonstrate an automated method to simplify this process by modifying an existing or related model---suggesting nonlinear terms and structural modifications---or even constructing a new model that agrees with the system's time series observations. In certain cases, this method can identify the full dynamical model from scratch without prior knowledge or structural assumptions. The algorithm selects between multiple candidate models by designing experiments to make their predictions disagree. We performed computational experiments to analyze a nonlinear seven-dimensional model of yeast glycolytic oscillations. This approach corrected mistakes reliably in both approximated and overspecified models. The method performed well to high levels of noise for most states, could identify the correct model de novo , and make better predictions than ordinary parametric regression and neural network models. We identified an invariant quantity in the model, which accurately derived kinetics and the numerical sensitivity coefficients of the system. Finally, we compared the system to dynamic flux estimation and discussed the scaling and application of this methodology to automated experiment design and control in biological systems in real time.}},

abstract ={Complex nonlinear dynamics arise in many fields of science and engineering, but uncovering the underlying differential equations directly from observations poses a challenging task. The ability to symbolically model complex networked systems is key to understanding them, an open problem in many disciplines. Here we introduce for the first time a method that can automatically generate symbolic equations for a nonlinear coupled dynamical system directly from time series data. This method is applicable to any system that can be described using sets of ordinary nonlinear differential equations, and assumes that the (possibly noisy) time series of all variables are observable. Previous automated symbolic modeling approaches of coupled physical systems produced linear models or required a nonlinear model to be provided manually. The advance presented here is made possible by allowing the method to model each (possibly coupled) variable separately, intelligently perturbing and destabilizing the system to extract its less observable characteristics, and automatically simplifying the equations during modeling. We demonstrate this method on four simulated and two real systems spanning mechanics, ecology, and systems biology. Unlike numerical models, symbolic models have explanatory value, suggesting that automated “reverse engineering” approaches for model-free symbolic nonlinear system identification may play an increasing role in our ability to understand progressively more complex systems in the future.},

abstract={The problem of the inference of finite-state probabilistic grammars is studied from two points of view. First, the theoretical aspects of grammatical inference are considered. Among the topics investigated are the structural and statistical properties of probabilistic grammars, methods for assigning probability measures to rewrite rules of probabilistic grammars, and statistical measures for determining how well an inferred probabilistic grammar approximates a sample set. The second concern of the study is the development and implementation of an algorithm for the inference of finite-state probabilistic grammars. This finite-state inference procedure produces a deterministic finite-state probabilistic grammar whose language approximates the sample set within a user-supplied acceptance region under the chi-square test. This procedure is enumerative. Heuristic tree-searching techniques are used to improve efficiency. The convergence of the procedure to an acceptable grammar is demonstrated and the steps of the procedure are theoretically justified. Test results of a PL/I implementation are presented. The inference procedure developed provides a means of synthesizing a probabilistic model of both physical and abstract systems from samples of their behavior.},

  abstract = {``We won't comment here on the long history of the book, which is recounted in [E. L. Lehmann, Statist. Sci. 12 (1997), no. 1, 48--52; MR1466430], but shall use this Preface to indicate the principal changes from the second edition [E. L. Lehmann, Testing statistical hypotheses, Second edition, Wiley, New York, 1986; MR0852406 (87j:62001)]. ``The present volume is divided into two parts. Part I (Chapters 1--10) treats small-sample theory, while Part II (Chapters 11--15) treats large-sample theory. The preface to the second edition stated that `the most important omission is an adequate treatment of optimality paralleling that given for estimation in the companion volume [E. L. Lehmann and G. Casella, Theory of point estimation, Second edition, Springer, New York, 1998; MR1639875 (99g:62025)]'. We here remedy this failure by treating the difficult topic of asymptotic optimality (in Chapter 13) together with the large-sample tools needed for this purpose (in Chapters 11 and 12). Having developed these tools, we use them in Chapter 14 to give a much fuller treatment of tests of goodness of fit than was possible in the second edition, and in Chapter 15 to provide an introduction to the bootstrap and related techniques. Various large-sample considerations that in the second edition were discussed in earlier chapters now have been moved to Chapter 11.

``Another major addition is a more comprehensive treatment of multiple testing including some recent optimality results. This topic is now presented in Chapter 9. In order to make room for these extensive additions, we had to eliminate some material found in the second edition, primarily the coverage of the multivariate linear hypothesis.

``Except for some of the basic results from Part I, a detailed knowledge of small-sample theory is not required for Part II. In particular, the necessary background should include: Chapter 3, Sections 3.1--3.5, 3.8--3.9; Chapter 4: Sections 4.1--4.4; Chapter 5, Sections 5.1--5.3; Chapter 6, Sections 6.1--6.2; Chapter 7, Sections 7.1--7.2; Chapter 8, Sections 8.1--8.2, 8.4--8.5.'' },

Section 4 is concerned with estimation and examines semiparametric procedures in both the frequency and time domain, and also the properties of various regression based and maximum likelihood techniques. Long memory volatility processes are discussed in Section 5, while Section 6 discusses applications in economics and finance. The paper also has a concluding section."

A new application for the Hurst parameter, real-time event detection, is identified. Hurst estimates using rescaled range, dispersional and bridgedetrended scaled windowed variance analyses of seizure time-series recorded from human subjects reliably detect their onset, termination and intensity. Detection sensitivity is unaltered by signal decimation and window size increases. The high sensitivity to brain state changes, ability to operate in real time and small computational requirements make Hurst parameter estimation using any of these three methods well suited for implementation into miniature implantable devices for contingent delivery of anti-seizure therapies.",

abstract = "Fractal dimension (FD) is a natural measure of the irregularity of a curve. In this study the performances of three waveform FD estimation algorithms (i.e. Katz's, Higuchi's and the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm) were compared in terms of their ability to detect the onset of epileptic seizures in scalp electroencephalogram (EEG). The selection of parameters involved in FD estimation, evaluation of the accuracy of the different algorithms and assessment of their robustness in the presence of noise were performed based on synthetic signals of known FD. When applied to scalp EEG data, Katz's and Higuchi's algorithms were found to be incapable of producing consistent changes of a single type (either a drop or an increase) during seizures. On the other hand, the k-NN algorithm produced a drop, starting close to the seizure onset, in most seizures of all patients. The k-NN algorithm outperformed both Katz's and Higuchi's algorithms in terms of robustness in the presence of noise and seizure onset detection ability. The seizure detection methodology, based on the k-NN algorithm, yielded in the training data set a sensitivity of 100% with 10.10 s mean detection delay and a false positive rate of 0.27 h(-1), while the corresponding values in the testing data set were 100%, 8.82 s and 0.42 h(-1), respectively. The above detection results compare favourably to those of other seizure onset detection methodologies applied to scalp EEG in the literature. The methodology described, based on the k-NN algorithm, appears to be promising for the detection of the onset of epileptic seizures based on scalp EEG."

     abstract = {Let F̂n denote the empirical distribution function for a sample of n i.i.d. random variables with distribution function F. In 1956 Dvoretzky, Kiefer and Wolfowitz proved that $P\big(\sqrt{n} \sup_x(\hat{F}_n(x) - F(x)) > \lambda\big) \leq C \exp(-2\lambda^2),$ where C is some unspecified constant. We show that C can be taken as 1 (as conjectured by Birnbaum and McCarty in 1958), provided that exp(-2λ2) ≤ 1/2. In particular, the two-sided inequality $P\big(\sqrt{n} \sup_x|\hat{F}_n(x) - F(x)| > \lambda\big) \leq 2 \exp(-2\lambda^2)$ holds without any restriction on λ. In the one-sided as well as in the two-sided case, the constants cannot be further improved.},
